## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-27

First public release.

### Added

- Render ```` ```plantuml ```` fenced code blocks as inline SVG in the built-in
  Markdown preview, powered by [`@plantuml/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@plantuml/core)
  (PlantUML compiled to JavaScript/WebAssembly). No Java, no PlantUML server,
  no network access.
- Rendering runs in a worker thread on the extension host; only sanitised SVG
  is injected into the preview.
- Serialised rendering queue — many diagrams per page render correctly, and one
  failing diagram never blocks the others.
- Syntax errors appear inline at the failing diagram; the rest of the page is
  unaffected.
- Dark-mode rendering that follows the VS Code colour theme, with a
  `plantumlLocal.theme` setting (`auto` / `light` / `dark`) to pin the palette.
- `PlantUML Local: Clear Render Cache and Re-render` command.
- `plantumlLocal.logLevel` setting for the output channel.
- Localised UI (English, Japanese).

### Security

- SVG output is sanitised in the worker (scripts, event handlers and non-fragment
  links are removed) before it reaches the preview.
- URL-based `!include` / `!theme` directives are rejected with an inline message.
- happy-dom's bundled self-signed TLS certificate (unused fetch machinery) is
  stripped from the worker bundle at build time.
